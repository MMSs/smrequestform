# Social Media Request Form (SMRF)

A frontend only app, runable on [mmss.github.io/smrf](https://mmss.github.io/smrf), designed for the marketing team to generate request cards for the creative team to design images for social media platforms.  The marketer chooses the channel (business) they need the request for, then the social media platforms, image types, and the languages they need the creative art in.

Based on the chosen fields, the app will generate request cards containing the information selected by the requester in addition to a few predefined technical specification.  The cards then can be printed or emailed.

The app is built in jQuery, UnderscoreJS, and SASS, and runs completely in the browser with a simple backend server.
